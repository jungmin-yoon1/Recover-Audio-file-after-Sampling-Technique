## Recover-Audio-file-after-Sampling-Technique

#### Project Purpose
- To understand the process of sampling and quantization.
- To see how much the original signal and the restoration signal match.

#### Project Procedure
- Read the file(wav) to generate discrete signals
- Sampling the discrete signals
- Reconstruct the sampled signals
- Check the signals

#### Result
